Include a README.md file that explains the contents of the repo.
The code in the repo should be neat and well documented.  Likely this won't be the "first draft" of your code.
DO NOT include any private API keys in your code or elsewhere in the repo.
If possible, include your dataset in the repo. 

    Do not include the data if it violates the any terms and conditions of the API (for example, Twitter won't allow you to make the full data public, but you can publish Tweet IDs).  
    Do not include the dataset if it is too large for GitHub
    If you have any concerns about the privacy of your data or other concerns about publishing your data, please discuss them with Dr. Kerby

THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT YOUR BLOG REPO!!.  This repo should be a separate repository on GitHub



README:
This repo obtains all the movies published by Disney, from 1937 to October 2025, from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney_Pictures_films, and obtains their ratings, revenue, and other relevant information from their respective entries in Rotten Tomatoes. This information is then analyzed and we report on the findings. 
The cleaned dataset can be found within this repo if you would like to use it.
